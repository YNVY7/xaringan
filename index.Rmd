# What is the IKONOS-2 satellite?
]

- IKONOS-2 was a satellite launched in 1999 and decommissioned in 2015
- It was the first commercial satellite to collect images with a resolution of 0.8m
- It was originally launched with another identical satellite (Ikonos-1) which failed to launch
- It lasted for 15 years despite having a design life of 7 years - the sensor was decommissioned when attempts to resolve an accuracy irregularity failed

# Satellite details
]

## Spatial Resolution
- Panchromatic images - 0.8m
- Multispectral imagery - 3.2m 
- It was able to capture both of these image types at once as it carried an instrument called the Optical Sensor Assembly (OSA)

##Other details
- Revisiting frequency - 3 days
- Orbiting altitude - 681m
- Off-nadar pointing angle - 30 degrees

#Significance of Ikonos-2

## At the time, the functioning of Ikonos-2 was unique in relation to other commercial satellites
]


- This is because it allowed each international association to have allocated time where they could task the satellite and receive the imagery instantly

- It was the first commercial imaging satellite with a spatial resolution of less than 1m

- The significance of this satellite is that it also represented the start of the production and use of earth observation data of a spatial resolution of 1 metre

# Studies which have used Ikonos-2 imagery
]
## River flood damage assessment (Van der Sande, 2001)
This study used Ikonos-2 data to identify urban and suburban features as part of land use mapping for damage assessments. It was noted in this paper that due to the large information the imagery contains, it was hard to extract objects.

##Characterisation of suburban areas for land use planning (Greenhill, et al., 2003)
This study utilised ecological indicators such as a vegetation index derived from Ikonos-2 data to identify the spatial distributions and different types of land cover in suburban areas in London. The imagery used was multispectral and the paper noted that this type of imagery can be used in land use planning for future sustainable development.

##Using Ikonos-2 imagery for forest structure variable estimation (Kayitakire, et al., 2006)
This paper performed image texture analysis on Ikonos-2 data in order to identify key forest variables such as age, circumference and basal area. The use of both panchromatic and multispectral Ikonos-2 imagery demonstrated lower estimation errors for many of these variables compared to other sensors, however some estimation errors were still too high for planning use. 

##Urban population estimates using Ikonos-2 and lidar data (Tomas, et al., 2015)
This paper estimated urban populations through analysing the volume of one story houses and high rise buildings, highlighting common issues of underestimation in official statistics. The Ikonos-2 and lidar data were used to create a digital surface model. This study shows once more how Ikonos-2's multispectral and panchromatic data can be used together during analysis.

##Ikonos-2 had a significant and lasting impact on Earth Observation data 
]
- Learning about this sensor has helped me to understand more about the history of remote sensing imagery, and how it has gained popularity and changed over the last 20 years

- It is interesting how at the time, remotely sensed images of 1 metre resolution were novel, compared to now  where they are far more common 

- I have also learnt through the applications section more ways in which sensor data can be used

- I also found it interesting how the sensor was able to continue for more than double its original design life, and how it can be assumed that more effort was not made in fixing it so it was because others sensors which were in use by that time were sufficient enough that Ikonos-2 was not needed anymore :(

#Reflection 2
]
- Ikonos-2 contributed to increasing work at the time in showing the value of remotely sensed data

- The owner of Ikonos-2, DigitalGlobe, are now able to use and are continuing to improve the use of remotely sensed data in disaster relief aid

- It seems to me that without the gains from Ikonos-2 this progress may have been a lot slower 

- Ikonos-2 also allowed Earth Observation data to be used in many new ways. However, there is now an abundance of data

- In the future I think we must understand how this data can be used more efficiently and maximise its potential especially with regards to sustainability, climate change, population growth and to contribute to the SDGs
